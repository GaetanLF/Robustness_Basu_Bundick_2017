# Robustness of Basu & Bundick (2017) [WORK IN PROGRESS]
### Author: Gaëtan LE FLOCH (with some codes from Brent BUNDICK's website).

This code aims to assess the robustness of the empirical findings of Basu &amp; Bundick (2017) by implementing (i) local projections and (ii) a non-linear VAR.

## The core paper

In 2017, Susanto Basu and Brent Bundick published the following paper:

Basu, S. and Bundick, B. (2017). Uncertainty shocks in a model of effective demand. Econometrica, Vol.85 (3), p.937-958.

Through theoretical and empirical models, they find - among other conclusions - that increased uncertainty about the future likely played a role in worsening the Great Recession.

## On the empirical tools used

These are mainstream models in the toolbox of any applied macroeconomist. They are explained in:

* Local projections (LP): Jordà (2005).

* Bayesian Local Projections (BLP): Miranda-Agrippino & Ricco (2021).

* Markov-Switching VAR: Krolzig (1997).

## How to run the codes ?

WIP.
